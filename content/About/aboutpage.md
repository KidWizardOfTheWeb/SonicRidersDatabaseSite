## Introduction

This site serves as a informative resource for Sonic Riders Tournament Edition, a mod for the GameCube version of Sonic Riders (2006). 

You'll find in-depth information about the game's mechanics, characters, gears, and more.

Each post under a section can be filtered through by clicking on the `#`s to find posts with the same ones attached to them.

Hint: The text at the top that reads `Sonic Riders Database` leads back to here (the homepage).
