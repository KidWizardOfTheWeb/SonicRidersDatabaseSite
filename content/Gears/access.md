## The dual type board gear

Even without wings, you can still fly with the Access gear! Trade some stats for the ability to grant your rider fly type in addition to their base type.  
Picking Access on a character who is already fly type will gain extra speed from fly type shortcuts.

Access is suited for cruising with higher top speed and acceleration, excelling on stages with long straightaways and giving some extra speed to your flight capabilities.  

Pick Access on stages where you might want some extra flexibility with your routing; or to surprise your opponents by mixing up your position.
