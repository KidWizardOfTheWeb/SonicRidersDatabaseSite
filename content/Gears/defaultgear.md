## Standard Gear of many looks

While all characters in Sonic Riders has a unique version of this gear available to them, they all perform the same in terms of statistics and gameplay.

Colloquially called "Default gear" or "Default" by the community at large, what it lacks in special mechanics, it gains in pure flexibility in races with two of it's main properties.

Most other gears lose speed while charging jump, meaning that they will slow down and lose time while charging. Default is different, as not losing speed while charging jump means it gains easy access to tech known as "JCBC" (**J**ump-**C**ancel **B**oost-**C**hain), Bonk Dashing, and Attack Slide. Using these techniques means that default can generate or retain high speeds where other gears cannot.

Default also has higher air gain while using type shortcuts, an uncommon trait for most gears that means better fuel economy for good shortcut usage during the race. 10% may seem small on paper, but that extra 10% means a lot for all shortcut types.

Speed and fly gain air per frame during their shortcut, meaning that each frame of air gain is multiplied by 10% more air. This adds up quickly over a short span of time, giving more opportunity to flex the air gained from type shortcuts in air-consuming mechanics.
